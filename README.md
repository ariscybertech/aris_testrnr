# Dart Test Runner

The Dart Test Runner (DTR) is a command line Test Runner for Dart test files.
DTR will automatically detect and run all the tests in your Dart project in the
correct environment (VM or Browser).

## Installation and usage

DTR is available for download on the
[Pub Package Manager](https://pub.dartlang.org/packages/test_runner)

To install DTR use this command:

    pub global activate test_runner

To run DTR use this command from within the root of your Dart project:

    pub global run test_runner

Alternatively you can add the pub cache `bin` directory to your PATH:
`~/.pub-cache/bin`. Then you will be able to simply use (`-c` gives a nice
colored output):

    run_tests -c

For a list of options and to learn more use:

    run_tests --help

### Result

Here is an example of output from the Dart test runner:

    bash> run_tests

    Checking Dart binaries...
    Dart binaries OK.

    Looking for Dart project in "./"...
    Found project "test-runner".

    Looking for test suites...
    Found 5 test suites (3 Standalone VM, 2 Dartium).

    Checking browser binaries...
    Browser binaries OK.

    Running all tests...
    Test suite passed: /vm_ok_test.dart
    Test suite passed: /subdir/vm_in_subdir_ok_test.dart
    Test suite failed: /vm_fail_test.dart
    Detailed results of test suite vm_fail_test.dart:
    ┌────────────────────────────────────────────────
    │ FAIL: QuickSort
    │   Expected: equals [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] ordered
    │     Actual: [3, 5, 2, 4, 1]
    │      Which: was <3> instead of <1> at location [0]
    │   ...
    │ FAIL: Partition
    │   Expected: <1>
    │     Actual: <0>
    │   ...
    │ 0 PASSED, 2 FAILED, 0 ERRORS
    └────────────────────────────────────────────────
    Test suite passed: /browser_ok_test.dart
    Test suite passed: /browser_ok_with_html_test.dart

    Summary: 1 TEST SUITE(S) FAILED. 4 TEST SUITE(S) PASSED.

TIP: use the `-c` option to get a nice colored output

The exit code will be:

 - If all tests passed: `0`
 - If at least one test has failed: `1`
 - Incorrect command line argument (e.g. missing `pub` or `dart2js`, incorrect
   project path...): `2`
 - If no test files were found in the project: `3`

## Test files detection and conventions

Your tests have to follow certain conventions to be reliably detected by DTR.
Please make sure that:

 - Your tests files are suffixed with `_test.dart`
 - Each test file contains a `main()` that runs all your unit tests.

Depending on the environment into which your test runs there are additional
requirements listed below.

Each test file is considered a "test suite". If a test suites does not complete
in 240 seconds it is aborted.

### Standalone VM tests

Standalone VM tests are tests that can be run from the command line using
'dart'. The executable of the test needs to return an exit code of 0 if all
tests were successful and 1 or more if there was an error.

NOTE: Typically if you wrote your Standalone VM tests using the
[unittest package](https://pub.dartlang.org/packages/unittest) you should be all
set.

### Browser tests

Browser tests are tests that need to be ran in a browser environment such as
dartium.

Browser tests will be executed in a headless version of Chromium for Dart called
Content Shell. Content Shell is not the same thing as Dartium. If you don't have
Content Shell installed read the [specific section](#content-shell) about it.

If all tests have passed your test needs to print `PASS\n` ("PASS" followed by a
line break).

You can provide an HTML file for a Browser Test. The HTML file needs to
have the same base name (for `my_test.dart` use `my_test.html`).

You don't have to write an HTML file associated to your browser tests. The Dart
test runner will automatically use a default HTML file and run your Browser
tests in it if you didn't provide a custom one.

DTR will automatically detect if a test file needs to be ran inside a Browser if
there is no associated HTML file.

NOTE: Typically if you wrote browser tests using the
[unittest package](https://pub.dartlang.org/packages/unittest) you should be all
set as the Dart test runner will automatically and transparently set an
appropriate test `Configuration` and will import
`packages/unittest/test_controller.js` into the HTML page.

## Tools and environment

DTR runs on Linux, Mac OS X and Windows. DTR also needs the following tools
installed:

 - Content Shell: A headless version of Dartium. Needed to run browser tests.
   Not the same thing as Dartium. Make sure you read the
   [specific section](#content-shell) about it
 - Dart SDK: Especially the `pub` command which will be used to run and serve
   tests and `dart2js` which is used to detect browser tests.

Ideally make sure that these tools are available in your PATH as `pub`,
`dart2js` and `content_shell` (with a `.bat` or `.exe` extension in Windows).
You can also specify the path to these tools executables with
`--content-shell-bin`, `--pub-bin` and `--dart2js-bin`.

### Content Shell

Content Shell is a stripped down version of Dartium/Chromium and it has the
ability to run headlessly. This is not the same thing as Dartium and if you
haven't already you likely need to install it.

For step-by=step instructions on how to install Content Shell on different
operating systems read
[CONTENT_SHELL_INSTALL_INSTRUCTIONS.md](CONTENT_SHELL_INSTALL_INSTRUCTIONS.md).

## Options and examples

### Usage

Generic usage of DTR:

    run_tests [options] [<project-or-tests>...]

Where `<project-or-tests>` is the path to the project root/test folder or a list
of path to individual test files to run. If omitted all tests of the current
project will be discovered and ran.

### Options

`--content-shell-bin`: Path to the Content Shell executable. If omitted
                       "content_shell" from env is used.

`--pub-bin`: Path to the Pub executable. If omitted "pub" from env is used.

`--dart-bin`: Path to the Dart executable. If omitted "dart" from env is used.

`--dart2js-bin`: Path to the dart2js executable. If omitted "dart2js" from env
                 is used.

`--skip-browser-tests`: Skips all browser tests. Useful when browser binaries
                        like content_shell are not available.

`--max-processes`: Maximum number of processes that will run in parallel.
                   Defaults to "auto" which depends on the number of processors
                   available. Otherwise an integer is expected.

`--disable-ansi`: Disables the special ANSI character used in the console
                  output for things like dynamic line updating and color. This
                  is activated automatically on Windows.

`-c` or `--color`: Prints the output in color in a shell.

`-v` or `--verbose`: Prints all tests results instead of just the summary.

`-h` or `--help`: Print usage information.

### Examples

Runs all unit tests of the project in the current directory with a colored
output:

    run_tests -c

Runs the specified two unit test files:

    run_tests test/my_first_test.dart test/my_second_test.dart

Runs all unit tests of the Dart project located at `~/my_project/`:

    run_tests ~/my_project/

Runs all tests of the project located at `~/my_project/` and use
`~/dartium/content_hell` as the Dartium executable.

    run_tests --content-shell-bin ~/dartium/content_shell ~/my_project/

## Test using Docker

The test environment can sometimes be tricky to setup (for instance Content
Shell in Linux). As an alternative we are providing a Docker image that can
be used to run your tests. There are also options to automatically run tests of
Pub packages or GitHub repos.
